# learning_app

I am developing an application that teaches you the Japanese language through a picture of the concept you want to learn, along with its name in English and Japanese, in addition to the sound of the word.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:
